# e-library
This project aims to address the challenges in traditional library data management by providing a comprehensive solution for an online library database management system. 
In a library, efficient organization and accessibility of data are crucial for smooth operations. This system encompasses a set of SQL queries (ddl-query) for creating essential tables and a Python script (dummy.py) to generate dummy data for testing purposes.
